# Word-Embedding

We built a simple Movie Review Sentiment Classifier which achieved 83% accuracy.

It was trained with TensorFlow build-in "imdb", which is a movie review database for binary sentiment classification.
imdb supplies a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing.

A byproduct of the classifier is an "Embedding Matrix",
which has vocabulary size 10,000 and dimension 16.
We visualized it with Google Embedding Projector.
